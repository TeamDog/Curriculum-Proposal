What I did:
    Created variables for wfName and initialState
    Fixed initializing empty array
    Came up with idea to create unique identifier for wfName (not implemented, requires more stuff from RowanNewProposal)
    Changed order of function calls (Now that I think about it, createWorkflow should probably not be called from construct)
    Created variable to hold states from database query
    Fleshed out loop to fit php syntax (I think)
    Added custom node conditional in createWorkflow
    
What needs to be done:
    Setup creation of unique identifier for wfName
    Remove createWorkflow from construct and make it return a workflow
    Figure out how to pull info from database call to put into SeedDMS_Core_Workflow_State function call
    Not sure what actions are but whatever dealing with that is unfinished I believe
    Actually implement database queries (obviously)
